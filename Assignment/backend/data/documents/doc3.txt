Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a field of study focused on developing algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. It is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to improve their performance on tasks through experience.
The main categories of machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, algorithms are trained on labeled data, making it possible to predict outcomes for unseen data. Unsupervised learning involves finding patterns in unlabeled data, while reinforcement learning trains algorithms through a reward-based feedback system.
Common applications of machine learning include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. As computing power increases and data becomes more available, machine learning continues to advance rapidly.
