Introduction to Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity encompasses technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. As digital systems become more integral to modern life, cybersecurity has grown increasingly important.
Common cyber threats include:

Malware: Malicious software including viruses, worms, ransomware, and spyware
Phishing: Deceptive attempts to steal sensitive information through fake communications
Man-in-the-middle attacks: Intercepting communications between two parties
Denial-of-service attacks: Overwhelming systems to prevent legitimate access
SQL injection: Inserting malicious code into databases through input fields
Zero-day exploits: Attacks targeting previously unknown vulnerabilities

Cybersecurity practices involve multiple layers of protection. These include network security (protecting the communication infrastructure), application security (ensuring software is secure), endpoint security (protecting devices accessing the network), data security (protecting information itself), identity management (controlling access), and incident response planning.
Organizations increasingly adopt frameworks like NIST Cybersecurity Framework or ISO 27001 to structure their security efforts. As threats evolve, cybersecurity requires constant vigilance, regular updates, and ongoing education for all users.
