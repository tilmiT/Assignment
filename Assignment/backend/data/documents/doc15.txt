lassical Music Through the Ages
Classical music encompasses a broad tradition of formal composition spanning from the medieval period to the present day. While often referring specifically to music from the Classical period (1750-1820), the term more broadly includes Western art music across multiple eras.
The Medieval period (500-1400) featured Gregorian chant and early polyphony. The Renaissance (1400-1600) saw greater complexity with composers like Palestrina developing intricate vocal music. The Baroque era (1600-1750) brought dramatic styles with Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi creating elaborate counterpoint and ornamentation.
The Classical period proper, featuring Mozart, Haydn, and early Beethoven, emphasized clarity, balance, and formal structure. The Romantic era (1800-1910) embraced emotional expression and nationalism, with composers like Chopin, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner creating increasingly ambitious works.
The 20th century saw radical experimentation with atonality, serialism, minimalism, and electronic music through figures like Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Glass, and Stockhausen. Contemporary classical continues to evolve, often blending with popular and world music traditions.
Classical music is distinguished by its notation system, formal structures, extended compositions, and orchestral instrumentation. Major performance formats include symphonies, chamber music, concerti, operas, and solo recitals, typically performed in concert halls designed for acoustic excellence.
