Nutrition and Healthy Eating
Nutrition is the study of nutrients in food and how the body uses them for growth, metabolism, and repair. A balanced diet includes macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).
Proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues and are found in meat, dairy, eggs, and plant sources like legumes. Carbohydrates provide energy and are categorized as simple or complex, with complex carbohydrates from whole grains being generally healthier. Fats, while often vilified, are necessary for hormone production, vitamin absorption, and cell membrane integrity.
Dietary recommendations vary based on age, gender, activity level, and health conditions. However, general guidelines include:

Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables
Choosing whole grains over refined grains
Limiting added sugars and sodium
Consuming lean proteins and healthy fats
Staying hydrated by drinking adequate water

A healthy eating pattern, combined with regular physical activity, helps maintain weight and reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.
