Blockchain Technology Explained
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures data cannot be altered retroactively. It was first conceptualized by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 as the underlying technology for Bitcoin.
The core components of blockchain include:

Distributed ledger: A database shared and synchronized across multiple sites
Blocks: Packages of data that contain transaction information
Cryptographic hashing: Mathematical functions that convert data into fixed-length strings
Consensus mechanisms: Methods like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake that validate transactions

Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain has potential applications in supply chain management, healthcare records, voting systems, intellectual property protection, and smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.
Despite its promising applications, blockchain technology faces challenges related to scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory uncertainty.
