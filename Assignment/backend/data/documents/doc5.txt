Climate Change and Global Warming
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels. Since the Industrial Revolution began around 1750, human activities have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by more than 40%.
Global warming, a key aspect of climate change, is the observed increase in Earth's average surface temperature. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that global average temperatures have risen by about 1°C since pre-industrial times.
The consequences of climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, disruptions to ecosystems, and threats to food security. Melting polar ice caps, ocean acidification, and shifting precipitation patterns are also significant concerns.
International efforts to address climate change include the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C.
