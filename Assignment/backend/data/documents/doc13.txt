The Human Microbiome
The human microbiome refers to the trillions of microorganisms living in and on the human body, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archaea. These microbes outnumber human cells by approximately 10 to 1 and contain over 100 times more genes than the human genome.
Different body sites harbor distinct microbial communities. The gut microbiome is the largest and most studied, containing hundreds of species that help digest food, produce essential vitamins, and regulate the immune system. The skin microbiome varies across different body regions based on moisture, pH, and temperature. Other important microbiome sites include the mouth, lungs, and urogenital tract.
Research has linked the microbiome to numerous aspects of human health, including:

Digestive health and metabolism
Immune system development and function
Mental health through the gut-brain axis
Inflammatory conditions like IBD and arthritis
Obesity and metabolic disorders
Response to medications

Factors affecting microbiome composition include diet, antibiotic use, hygiene practices, environment, and genetics. The microbiome begins developing at birth and changes throughout life based on these factors.
Emerging therapeutic approaches targeting the microbiome include probiotics (beneficial live microorganisms), prebiotics (substances that promote beneficial microbes), and fecal microbiota transplantation for treating certain conditions like C. difficile infection.
