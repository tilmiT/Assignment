Financial Literacy Fundamentals
Financial literacy encompasses the knowledge and skills needed to make informed and effective financial decisions. Core concepts include budgeting, saving, investing, debt management, and financial planning.
Budgeting involves tracking income and expenses to understand cash flow and ensure spending aligns with priorities. A common approach is the 50/30/20 rule, allocating 50% of income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings and debt repayment.
Saving is essential for financial security, with emergency funds typically recommended to cover 3-6 months of expenses. Banking options include checking accounts for daily transactions and savings accounts for emergency funds and short-term goals.
Investing involves putting money into assets with the expectation of generating returns over time. Common investment vehicles include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. Investment decisions should consider time horizon, risk tolerance, and diversification.
Debt management focuses on reducing high-interest debt while responsibly using credit. Credit scores, ranging from 300-850, impact borrowing ability and interest rates. Maintaining good credit involves paying bills on time, keeping credit utilization low, and monitoring credit reports.
Insurance protects against financial losses from unexpected events. Common types include health, life, auto, homeowners/renters, and disability insurance. Financial planning ties these concepts together through goal-setting and developing strategies to achieve financial objectives.
