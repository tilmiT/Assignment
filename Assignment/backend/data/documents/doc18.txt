The Science of Sleep
Sleep is a natural, recurring state characterized by reduced consciousness, limited sensory activity, and decreased muscle movement. The average adult requires 7-9 hours of sleep daily, though needs vary based on age, genetics, and health conditions.
Sleep architecture consists of multiple stages. Non-REM sleep includes three stages: N1 (light sleep), N2 (deeper sleep with sleep spindles and K-complexes), and N3 (deep sleep with slow delta waves). REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep features heightened brain activity, vivid dreaming, and muscle atonia. These stages cycle approximately every 90 minutes throughout the night.
Sleep serves multiple biological functions. It facilitates memory consolidation, transferring information from short-term to long-term memory. The glymphatic system activates during sleep, clearing metabolic waste from the brain. Sleep also supports immune function, emotional regulation, and hormone production, including growth hormone and melatonin.
Sleep disorders affect millions worldwide. Insomnia involves difficulty falling or staying asleep. Sleep apnea causes breathing interruptions during sleep. Restless leg syndrome creates uncomfortable sensations and movement urges. Narcolepsy involves excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden sleep attacks. Parasomnias include sleepwalking, night terrors, and REM behavior disorder.
Good sleep hygiene practices include maintaining consistent sleep schedules, creating comfortable sleep environments, limiting screen time before bed, avoiding caffeine and alcohol near bedtime, and regular exercise (though not immediately before sleep).
